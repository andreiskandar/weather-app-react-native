# Weather App
Weatherapp is a simple weather forecast app, which uses some APIs to fetch current data from the OpenWeatherMap based on current location and coordinates. It provides flexibility to change the unit system (metric or imperial) and other metrics: feels-like, humidity, wind speed and pressure. 

The main goal of this app is to be a sample of how to build an high quality Android application that uses expo-cli react-native
